# Agent Check: Notion

## Overview

Notion is a Connected Workspace. It's where modern teams create and share docs, take notes, manage projects, and organize knowledge-all in one place. Install Notion's integration with Datadog to manage and monitor your workspace activity in their Datadog Cloud SIEM. You can import your workspace's audit logs for real-time monitoring, alerting, and analysis. From there, you can detect and investigate potential security issues, suspicious behavior, and troubleshoot access with confidence and ease.

## Setup

In Notion navigate to Setting & Members > Connections > Workspace Connections > +Add Connection > Datadog. 

This will start the OAuth flow with Datadog. Once you've successfully authenticated, you will be redirected back to Notion, an integration tile will be created in the workspace connections view. 

## Uninstallation
In Notion navigate to Setting & Members > Connections > Workspace Connections > ... next to Datadog > Disconnect
