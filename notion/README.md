# Agent Check: Notion

## Overview

Notion is a Connected Workspace. It's where modern teams create and share docs, take notes, manage projects, and organize knowledge, all in one place. Install Notion's integration with Datadog to manage and monitor your workspace activity in [Datadog Cloud SIEM][1]. You can import your workspace's audit logs for real-time monitoring, alerting, and analysis. From there, you can detect and investigate potential security issues, suspicious behavior, and troubleshoot access with confidence and ease.

## Setup

In Notion navigate to Setting & Members > Connections > Workspace Connections > +Add Connection > Datadog. 

This starts the OAuth flow with Datadog. After you are successfully authenticated, you are redirected back to Notion, and an integration tile is created in the workspace connections view. 

## Uninstallation
In Notion navigate to Setting & Members > Connections > Workspace Connections > ... next to Datadog > Disconnect
