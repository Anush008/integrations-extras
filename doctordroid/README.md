# Doctor Droid

## Overview

Doctor Droid is an observability analytics platform. This integration allows Datadog users to analyze their alerts history to decide better thresholds for alerts and identify alerting coverage for their services. Users can also fetch metrics from upstream and downstream services to enrich their alerts for faster diagnosis.

## Setup

### Installation
Visit [Doctor Droid](https://alertops-app.drdroid.io/)  to sign up for free. Once registered, visit the [integrations page](https://alertops-app.drdroid.io/integrations)  and add a Datadog integration. This guides you through the Datadog OAUTH2 flow to grant Doctor Droid access to your API Keys to query APM & Infra metrics for you.

### Configuration
Once integrated, begin exploring your alerts history within Doctor Droid to discover trends. You can create reports and playbooks for enriching your alerts data once it is generated.
