    "description": "TaskCallâ€™s integration allows Datadog clients to bolster their operations by improving their incident awareness and simplifying the process in which they are handled. Incidents sync up bi-directionally between the two platforms. Once Datadog alerts are received in TaskCall, clients will be able to systematically manage all incidents without being interrupted. Clients will also benefit from improved impact visibility from dependency graphs and status dashboards.",
