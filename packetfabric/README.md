## Setup

### Installation

OAUTH is used to authenticate the user from datadog to PacketFabric.

On clicking on install, You would be taken to the PacketFabric login page to login and authorize the required permission scope that would be needed by PacketFabric to send your data to Datadog.

![scope permission authorization][3]

The user installing the app i.e. (admin) must have the `api_keys_write` permission, as an api key is generated by Datadog and this is what we would be using to send the metrics data to Datadog.

On completing the installation process, you should be able to access your dashboard in Datadog and see your metrics updated every 15 minutes.
