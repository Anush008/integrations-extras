# LoadRunner Professional

## Overview

OpenTextâ„¢ LoadRunner Professional provides a load testing solution that enables you to test the performance of diverse application types, and to identify and resolve issues before applications go live.

LoadRunner Controller is a tool for creating and controlling LoadRunner Professional scenarios. A scenario defines the events that occur during each testing session. It controls the number of users to emulate (virtual users, or Vusers), the actions they perform, and the machines on which they run their emulations. You use scenarios to create load tests to check the reliability and strength of your servers.

You can configure Controller to push real-time metrics and data from scenario runs to Datadog.


## Setup

Configure LoadRunner Controller to push data to Datadog. You can choose whether to send scenario information and/or run metrics. In Datadog, you can install a dashboard to view the data in pre-configured widgets.

1.	In the Controller toolbar, select __Tools > Datadog Configuration__.
2.	In the __Site__ field, select the region defined in your Datadog account.
3.	In the __API Key__ field, enter the API key generated by Datadog.
4.	Click __Test Connection__.
5.	Once the connection is successful, select whether to send scenario information and/or run information to Datadog:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|__Send scenario information__| Send information about the scenario run, such as the start and stop time, duration, and included scripts. |
|__Send run information__| Send metrics from the scenario run, such as Vuser status and transaction response times. |
	
6.	If you enable Controller to send scenario information, install the __LoadRunner Run Info Pipeline__ in Datadog to ensure that tags are applied to the scenario information.
7.	Optionally, in Datadog, install the __LoadRunner Stats__ dashboard. The dashboard includes widgets that display run information and scenario information (depending on the data that Controller is configured to send). 
When you run a Controller scenario, the data is displayed in the dashboard widgets.

Once Controller has been configured to push data to Datadog, the data is pushed each time you run a scenario in Controller. To disable Controller from pushing data to Datadog, select __Tools > Datadog Configuration__ and clear the fields in the Datadog Configuration dialog box.
